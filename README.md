# Angel's Haven

To view the live version of the website please click [AngelsHaven](https://gideongannaban.github.io/Milestone-Project-1/index.html)

My inspiration in making this project is our 22 months old daughter. We’re not putting her to creche since I’m working from home so pretty much I look after her during the day and my wife when she comes home after work. 
Thus, we’ve decided to look for a weekend activity where she can play and interact with other kids and at the same time learn new things. We found some interesting classes but unfortunately they were all in different locations. 
This means we can only chose one since going to other venues will take much of our time and effort. 
Then I came up with an idea, why not offer the most in demand classes in one location. 

# UX

Who is the target market?

Ideally our target markets are **parents or childminders** looking for a meaningful weekend bonding activities with their little ones. 

As a **parent or childminder**:

-	I want to see the programs being offered
-	I want to see the schedule of classes of each program
-	I want to see the prices of each program
-	I want to be able to contact the management for further inquiries
-	I want to be able to view the website using my mobile phone

# Design

 All through out the pages we've used 3 colors ( blue, yellow and red) and these were designated for each class offered. 

# Wireframe
 I used Balsamiq Wireframe 4 to create the framework for the website. There have been several modifications as the project progressed but below are the final outputs:

 * Desktop [View](https://github.com/gideongannaban/Milestone-Project-1/blob/master/Wireframes/Desktop%20View.pdf)
 * Ipad [View](https://github.com/gideongannaban/Milestone-Project-1/blob/master/Wireframes/Ipad%20View.pdf)
 * Mobile [View](https://github.com/gideongannaban/Milestone-Project-1/blob/master/Wireframes/Mobile%20View.pdf)

# Features

### Future Feature:

  In addition to existing features, my future plans are as follow:
-	Add a page where fellow parents can volunteer on either of the classes provided skills are matching with the requirement. 
-	Add more team members
-	Add more photos to each class gallery
-	Information about the corona-virus situation and what is being done to prevent the pandemic
-	Add corporate social responsibility page that shows how we give back to the community

# Technology used
- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) - To create the structure and content of the page
- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) - Used to style the website
- [Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/)- This framework was used to create a responsive mobile-first design and include functioning components.
- [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - I used the font awesome icons for the social media, location and contact details
- [Googlefonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Used to style the fonts of the website 
- [Favicon](https://favicon.io/) - Used to create the website icon 
- [Trello](https://trello.com/) - Used as my project management tool

# Testing 

The website's responsive layout was tested using the following:
* **Google Chrome Developer Tool** - This was the primary tool used to monitor the page responsiveness through different viewing platform like Desktop, mobile, Ipad and Ipad Pro
* Manual test using **Samsung Note 10, Sony Z5 and Iphone 5** by friends and family members
* Additonally the responsive design was tested using [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/) and [ami.responsivedesign.is](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) websites
* CSS and HMTL codes were tested using [validator.w3](https://validator.w3.org/)
* And finally, with the help of CI slack Community through the guidance of fellow students, alumni and CI Instructors

### Bug/Error Fixed
 An error was detected when viewing the page using an Ipad Pro through the Developer tool. There was an ample white space between the bottom of the page and the footer thus placing the footer close to the center of the page.
 This was fixed by adding more content and margin thus pushing the footer section at the bottom of the page.

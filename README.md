# Angel's Haven

My inspiration in making this project is our 22 months old daughter. We’re not putting her to creche since I’m working from home so pretty much I look after her during the day and wife when she comes home after work. 
Thus we’ve decided to look for a weekend activity where she can play and interact with other kids and at the same time to learn new things. We found some interesting classes but unfortunately they were all in different locations. 
Then I came up with an idea, why not offer the most in demand classes in one location. 

# UX

Who is the target market?

Ideally our target markets are **parents or childminders** looking for a meaningful weekend bonding activities with their little ones. 

As a **parent or childminder**:

-	I want to see the programs being offered
-	I want to see the schedule of classes of each program
-	I want to see the prices of each program
-	I want to be able to contact the management for further inquiries
-	I want to be able to view the website using my mobile phone

# Design

 All through out the pages we've used 3 colors ( blue, yellow and red) and these were designated for each class offered.  

# Wireframe
 I used Balsamiq Wireframe 4 to create the framework of the website. There have been several modifications as the project progressed. 

 * Desktop View Wireframe - [View](https://github.com/gideongannaban/Milestone-Project-1/blob/master/Desktop.bmpr)
